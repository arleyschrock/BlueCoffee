This is an experimental set of libraries that help you run general Java programs in Microsoft Azure worker roles,
or generally from a C# program running anywhere. On top of the general library (the Azure.JavaPlatform library),
I also have specialized libraries to run some OSS projects: currently I have support for ZooKeeper, Kafka
and Cassandra. Hopefully I'll add more in there (or even better people will help by expanding this with more
support).
